# Creating a Django Model for factions.json

Based on your factions.json file structure and the existing model, I'll provide an improved Django model that properly represents your faction data.

## Current JSON Structure

Your factions.json file has this structure:
```json
{
    "1": "Humans",
    "2": "Terminids",
    "3": "Automaton",
    "4": "Illuminate"
}
```

## Improved Faction Model

Here's an improved model for your factions that properly handles the IDs from your JSON file:

```python
from django.db import models

class Faction(models.Model):
    id = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    
    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "Faction"
        verbose_name_plural = "Factions"
        db_table = "factions"
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Class Name**: Changed from `factions` to `Faction` following Python class naming conventions (PascalCase)
2. **Custom ID Field**: Added an explicit `id` field with `primary_key=True` to use the specific IDs from your JSON file
3. **Meta Options**: Added Meta class with:
   - Proper singular and plural names for admin interface
   - Explicit table name to maintain compatibility if you've already created database tables

## Using This Model with Your Import Script

When importing data from your JSON file, you can now use this model with code like:

```python
# In your import script
for faction_id, faction_name in factions_data.items():
    Faction.objects.update_or_create(
        id=int(faction_id),  # Convert string ID to integer
        defaults={'name': faction_name}
    )
```

## Next Steps

1. Update your models.py file with this improved Faction model
2. Run migrations to apply the changes to your database:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Update your import_json_data.py script to use this model

This model will properly represent your factions data while following Django best practices.
